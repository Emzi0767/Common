# Looking for help with the code?
Depending on the kind of problem you're encountering, you may wish to try one of the following methods to resolve it.

Bear in mind, I will only provide support in english.

## Clean and rebuild your solution
Sometimes, problems are solved by simply cleaning the solution, restarting your IDE, and rebuilding the project. 

If your project refuses to build for some strange reason, try doing a fresh build. In Visual Studio, you can do so by 
going to Build > Clean Solution. After cleaning is done, restart Visual Studio, then go to Build > Rebuild Solution.

## Reinstall NuGet packages
NuGet isn't perfect, and sometimes, especially when updating other packages, some dependencies might get messed up. 
In such a situation, it is recommended you reinstall all NuGet packages, then perform a clean build.

## Report a bug
If you are absolutely positive you found a bug, [open an issue on GitHub][1].
