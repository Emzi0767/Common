# Summary
Short summary of the bug.

# Details
Some details about the bug. You should put as much information about your environment, exceptions, etc. as possible in 
here. This includes, but is not limited to, .NET Framework version (eg. .NET Core 2.2), operating system (Windows 7, 
Debian GNU/Linux 9, etc.), IDE (e.g. Visual Studio 2017), exception type, message, and stack trace.

Remember to include all of your messages in text, as nobody likes a screenshot of text. A good idea is to wrap stack 
traces in codeblocks, like this:

```
at SomeClass.SomeMethod() at N:\MyBot\SuperAwesomeCommands.cs: line 42
at SomeBot.Main(string[])
```
