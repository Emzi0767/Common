# Emzi's Common Code

[![NuGet][3]][2]

This library is a collection of reusable components I use across my various projects. While contributions are not 
unwelcome, you will need to provide me with a solid reason as to why your code should be included.

## Requirements
The library is built for .NET 6 and any .NET Standard 2.0 targets. It is unlikely I will ever support other targets,
as these are the ones I use in my projects. I simply have no need to target older runtimes.

## Installation and usage
You can obtain the latest stable releases from [NuGet][1]. To test latest features, you can build the `master` branch
yourself.

## Documentation and examples
The library is very small, and as all members are documented via XML docs, you should have no problems navigating 
around using just IntelliSense.

If you need more information, just browse the source.
